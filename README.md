# Known Issues

Android Studio Arctic Fox ships with Java 11.  This project uses a version of Gradle which does not run on Java 11 .  You will need to make sure you configure your Gradle JDK to use a Java 8 JDK or you're going to have a bad time.  

## Setting JDK Version

File > Settings > Build Execution Deployment > Gradle > Gradle JDK > Download > Amazon Coretto 1.8
This should get you to a decent state where you can build and run the project on an AVD.
